It is\\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\\nyou.
